        <h3>I had many favourite foods and Biryani is one of them</h3>
        <div class="fav">
            It is a flavourful dish that has a rich taste.
            It is a famous subcontinent dish that is popular around the world.</h4>
            <p>Biryani is my favourite because it has a lip-smacking flavour, and I love to eat it at least once a week.<br>
            My mother prepares very tasty and delicious biryani.
            She cooks the dish during weekends or on special occasions.
